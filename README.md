# UO-Life
Your guide to UO Life
Welcome, and thank you for stopping by to see what is offered here. 
First, lets talk about the environment and what can be expected.
All of the classic lands will be available along with the quests and new quests will be added. Also, there will be staff that may interact with you for a quest and give a unique reward. There are other lands to be discovered and just maybe, you can stake a claim and start your own city, be the mayor, collect taxes and fued with other cities!

Some of the things that set this shard apart from the others is that gold doesn't have the value you'd expect. Tokens are the new currency and a exchange process is underway to convert gold coins to tokens. There will still be things you can buy with gold, it doesn't hold the value you may expect. A person may request you to go perform a quest or go mine and get ingots or seek out something in lieu of gold.

Welcome to UO Life!
