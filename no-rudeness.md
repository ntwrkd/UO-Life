Looting

When out playing, it is requested that you do NOT loot other players corpses unless asked to do so by that player.

Cursing, Complaining, & Uncalled for behavior (unless in roleplay scene)
UO Life is a roleplay shard and mature behavior is expected at all times. 

Paging system/ Problems on shard

Players that find problems or needing help from staff are asked to send PM on chat system. If no staff is on at the time that you need help you may be able to use the " help stuck " option if other players can't help you.
Do NOT page for staff over global chat message. Staff does not see all public chat and may miss your May Day. PM windows are seen easiest.

Staff

UO-Life is NOT hiring staff members. Staff may ask a person if they are interested in being staff or an application will be posted. Players that choose to ask to be staff will tend to wind up in jail. Just a warning. Badmouthing or degrading staff will not be tolerated to any extent. This will result in you finding a new place to play. Your account will be deleted with no discussion.
