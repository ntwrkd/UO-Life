Looting
When out playing, it is requested that you do NOT loot other players corpses unless asked to do so by that player.

Cursing, Complaining, & Uncalled for behavior (unless in roleplay scene)
This ones pretty simple.... cursing and whining isn't tolerated. If you wish you may sit in your house until you're blue in the face cursing the fates that lagged you to death, etc. You will not be permitted to fill a journal with chat messages that are found uncalled for. If you feel the need to spew filth use the private messaging or party systems and only to others that will tolerate such talk.

Paging system/ Problems on shard
Players that find problems or needing help from staff are asked to send PM on chat system. If no staff is on at the time that you need help you may be able to use the " help stuck " option if other players can't help you.
Do NOT page for staff over global chat message. Staff does not see all public chat and may miss your May Day. PM windows are seen easiest.

Staff
UO-Life is NOT hiring staff members. Staff may ask a person if they are interested in being staff or an application will be posted. Players that choose to ask to be staff will tend to wind up in jail. Just a warning. Badmouthing or degrading staff will not be tolerated to any extent. This will result in you finding a new place to play. Your account will be deleted with no discussion.
