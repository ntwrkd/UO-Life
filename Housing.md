As posted in the README, roleplay is not only encouraged, it is rewarded! Having a house, castle, etc. is no longer the manner or method you might think it is. You would like a house you say? Be prepared for a different experience using the house placement tool. You can also go BUILD your own home if you join a player run city. Integrity is doing the right thing when no one is watching, you never know when staff is watching. The shard has tools to design houses and place them.
