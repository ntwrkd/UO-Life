As posted in the README, roleplay is not only encouraged, it is rewarded! Having a house, castle, etc. is no longer the manner or method you might think it is. You would like a house you say? Go and BUILD it. Integrity is doing the right thing when no one is watching, you never know when staff is watching. The shard has tools to design houses and place them.
